Target Version:
  v00.00.03

Target Description:
  With this version we start having more types to our machine, so we
  can start perform some actual calculations with it. Those
  calculations are still very primitive since we have no way to pass
  more than one argument to a procedure and we don't have any way to
  perform conditional processing.

  Nonetheless, this version adds support for 32bit signed integers,
  64bits double precision floating point numbers, characters and
  booleans. We also throw in some functions to act on those in
  order to test the machine, but those are crude and not meant for
  real usage thu far.

  After this, we have:
  1) a representation for 32bit (fixnum) signed integers;
  2) a representation for boolean values;
  3) a representation for 64bits double precision floating point
     numbers (flonum);
  4) successor and predecessor primtives for fixnums and flonums;
  5) negate primitive for fixnums and flonums;
  6) is_positive, is_zero and is_negative primitives for fixnums and
     flonums;
  7) logical not function for booleans;
